## Graceful Degradation and Service Workers:
Graceful degradation refers to designing and building an application with all the advanced features. It is then updated to adapt to environments where it may be difficult for the app to run. It ensures that the core functionality of the app is still working even if the environment may not support it. Service workers are similar to this because service workers help enhance the application's flexibility by allowing for offline access for example. They both improve the application's quality by making sure that the app still runs in different scenarios which means that they both improve user experience.
